It means that the Cameo gimbal is a device that can capture the world in a spherical field of view, just like a chameleon&#39;s eyes. A chameleon is a type of lizard that has eyes that can move independently and rotate 360 degrees, giving it a full view of its surroundings.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c1">Q: How many cameras can the Cameo gimbal mount and what are the advantages of having two cameras?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">A: The Cameo gimbal can mount </span><span class="c1">two cameras</span><span class="c0">, one on each side of the device. The advantages of having two cameras are that they can cover both the sky and ground, they can tilt and pan 360 degrees independently or jointly, and they can zoom in and out, and adjust the focus and exposure, according to the scene and the user&#39;s preference. Two cameras also allow for smart camera coordination and multiplied productivity, as explained in the following questions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c1">Q: What is the unique feature of the Cameo gimbal that allows it to capture a spherical field of view and why is it important?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">A: The unique feature of the Cameo gimbal is that it allows each camera to tilt and pan 360 degrees independently or jointly, covering both the sky and ground. This feature is important because it enables the user to capture a complete and comprehensive view of the environment, without missing any details or angles. A spherical field of view at least </span><span class="c1">doubles productivity</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for various applications, such as vertical inspection, mapping, and surveillance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c1">Q: What is the benefit of having AI software and hardware built into the Cameo gimbal and how does it work?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A: The benefit of having AI software and hardware built into the Cameo gimbal is that it enables smart camera coordination and enhanced productivity. The AI software and hardware work by processing camera imagery data and commanding the gimbal and cameras to execute smart actions optimally. For example, upon detecting certain suspicious targets, the AI drives the gimbal to point both cameras to the subject, then commands one camera to zoom in and the other to zoom out, to get both close-ups and panorama views of the scene. In another setting, the AI can also detect objects of interest, assign the capturing tasks to each camera, point the cameras to the assigned objects, command the cameras to zoom in, and capture the required images such that the total execution time is minimal.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c1">Q: How does the Cameo gimbal work like a chameleon&#39;s eyes and what are some examples of its intelligent actions?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A: The Cameo gimbal works like a chameleon&#39;s eyes by having two cameras functioning like the two eyes of a chameleon, capturing a 360-degree field of view. Each camera can zoom in and out, and adjust the focus and exposure, according to the scene and the user&#39;s preference. Some examples of its smart actions are:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&bull; For power line inspection, the AI can detect objects of interest, such as poles, wires, transformers, insulators, etc., assign the capturing tasks to each camera, point the cameras to the assigned objects, command the cameras to zoom in and capture the required images such that the total execution time is minimal.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&bull; For surveillance, the AI can detect potential threats or anomalies in the environment, such as intruders, fires, accidents, etc., point both cameras to them, and command one camera to zoom in for identification while another camera zooms out for context and overall situational awareness.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c1">Q: What are some of the applications of the Cameo gimbal and how does it improve them?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A: Some of the applications of the Cameo gimbal are:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">&bull; </span><span class="c1">Vertical inspection</span><span class="c0">: The Cameo gimbal can improve vertical inspection by doubling its productivity. Vertical inspection is the process of inspecting tall structures such as buildings, bridges, towers, etc., for defects or damages. By using two cameras that can cover both top and bottom parts simultaneously, instead of one camera that has to move up and down repeatedly, the Cameo gimbal can reduce inspection time significantly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">&bull; </span><span class="c1">Mapping</span><span class="c0">: The Cameo gimbal can improve mapping by doubling its productivity. Mapping is a process of creating accurate representations of geographic areas using aerial images. By using two cameras that can capture images side by side simultaneously, instead of one image at a time with one camera, the Cameo gimbal can reduce mapping time significantly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">&bull; </span><span class="c1">Surveillance</span><span class="c0">: The Cameo gimbal can improve surveillance by providing spherical coverage. Surveillance is a process of monitoring activities or situations for security or intelligence purposes. By using two cameras that can monitor front and rear areas simultaneously, instead of one camera that has to rotate constantly, the Cameo gimbal can increase surveillance coverage significantly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c1">Q: What are the weight and payload of the Cameo gimbal and why are they important?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A: The weight and payload of the Cameo gimbal are 3 lbs and 1.5 lbs x 2, respectively. The weight and payload are important because they affect the performance and compatibility of the device. The weight is the total mass of the device, including the cameras and batteries. The payload is the maximum mass that each camera can carry. The lower the weight and the higher the payload, the better the device can perform and the more cameras it can support.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c9">Q: What are some of the compatible cameras with the Cameo gimbal and how can I connect them?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">A: Some of the compatible cameras with the Cameo gimbal are those that have HDMI output and remote control capability. The Cameo Gimbal can mount </span><span class="c1">two</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Sony CX90100</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;full-frame cameras or </span><span class="c1">two EO-IR</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">HeraSights</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;HDMI output is a type of interface that allows video and audio signals to be transmitted from a camera to a monitor or a recorder. Remote control capability is a feature that allows a camera to be controlled by an external device, such as a smartphone or a tablet. To connect a compatible camera to the Cameo gimbal, you need to use an HDMI cable and a remote control app. You can find more information on how to connect your camera in this article.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c22 c25"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c22 c23"><span class="c9 c10"></span></p></body></html>
